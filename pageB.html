            <p>My old school was Mailand in Lørenskog. I studied "Studiespesialisering". Mailand is a pretty new school, so its quite modern. </p>

            <h1>Theodor 383084</h1>
            <p>My old school was Lørenskog high school located, shockingly, in Lørenskog. The school was probably the best around my area, far outclassing the others such as Mailand. Both the teachers and the cantina was way better than the rest. They served both cold and warm food. Every friday i would eat a sandwitch with chicken and onions, it was delicious!</p>
